# HostLookup
This tool is used for looking up information on domains or IPs

Please note for the Censys part of the tool you will need to install the "Censys" library and make an account on censys.io to get yourself an API key + secret

Because I have no idea why I cannot use the JSON that Censys returns in order to make it "prettier", I will not be implementing that, unless some person decides to fork this and make that a thing.
